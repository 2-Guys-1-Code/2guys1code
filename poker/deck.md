Each suited card in the deck is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., a number between 1 and 208)
Before the start of each hand, the deck is ‘created’ by using a random number generator, randomly ordering these numbers.
Once the deck has been built, the hand is then dealt as it would be in a live game with each player being given two cards, starting with the small blind.


When you first open a deck, you’ll usually see the Jokers at the face, followed by the Spades and Diamonds in ascending order, then the Clubs and Hearts in descending order. At the very back or top of the deck, you’ll get a few ad cards — or perhaps a double backer or gimmick card, depending on the deck.
