Playing cards is a cards game, a standard deck of 54 cards contain 4 suit, clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), spades (♠)., and 2 jokers.


Each suited card in the deck is assigned a unique identifier
Before the start of each hand, the deck is ‘created’ by using a random number generator, randomly ordering these numbers.
Once the deck has been built, the hand is then dealt as it would be in a live game with each player being given two cards, starting with the small blind.
