Each suited card in the deck is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., a number between 1 and 208)
Before the start of each hand, the deck is ‘created’ by using a random number generator, randomly ordering these numbers.
Once the deck has been built, the hand is then dealt as it would be in a live game with each player being given two cards, starting with the small blind.
